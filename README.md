# ExpenseCategorizer
Expense categorizer for my budget tracking.
If you want to use it for your needs, then here what you need to do - 

1. Review and modify (if required) the Input.java to suite the format of your statements.
2. Update the metadata.csv with your own category/sub-category and add the keywords.
3. Run the MyMain.java , give the directory/file paths.
